# Needs-system-for-rpg
my names is Miguel, i am 12 years old and i made this script for my rpg with my friend, he suggested to post this as an open source project on github, so i did it.

The "what is the need.py" archive is the main code, for execute it you need to have the library pyperclip, the setup.py is the code that i use to compile the main code in a .exe archive, to get the .exe archive you need to extract the Buil.rar archive. you will get a Build folder, inside of it will be the exe.win-amd64-3.7 folder, and inside of it will be .exe archive

obs: I am brazilian, so i am sorry if you don't understand the variables names and comentarys.

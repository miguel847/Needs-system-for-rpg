# Needs-system-for-rpg
my names is Miguel, i am 12 years old and i made this script for my rpg with my friend, he suggested to post this as an open source project on github, so i did it.

The "what is the need.py" archive is the main code, for execute it you need to have the library pyperclip, the setup.py is the code that i use to compile the main code in a .exe archive, the .exe inside the of the exe.win-amd64-3.7 folder that is inside of the Build folder
